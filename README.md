# up_in_time
It is a django-powered web app which can create reminders or alarms just by a single click.

Just clone the git repo, cd into it and run ```./manage.py runserver```
and then visit here[http://127.0.0.1:8000/alarm/]

##Still To-Do:

* Obviously, give it some better looks.
* Embed music in pop up so that there is actually an alarm
* Make and add a favicon
* Add contact us, about_us page.
* Look for a way by which webbrowser.open("alarm set") which opens tab only in the default browser can open it in the same browser perhaps by manipulating HTTP_USER_AGENT.

##Features

* Works even if you have changed the window.
* If you have switched into fullscreen, then also the alarm pop up is shown.

## Dependencies

* python
* django v1.9.8
* Make sure that pop ups are allowed in your browser.

### Happy Time Saving
